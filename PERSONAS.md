# Make YOU Amazing

**Whatever your role, chat2repo turns your ChatGPT conversations into a personal knowledge system — with automations that do the boring bits for you.**

---

## How It Works For You

You already use ChatGPT for your work. You already have great conversations.

The problem? Those ideas disappear into chat history.

chat2repo captures them with one click, organizes them automatically, and — with a bit of setup — triggers "little robots" that format, check, compile, and email your work back to you.

**Pick your role below to see what's possible.**
