## The Hero Feature: "Go Build This"

**Turn a conversation into a working MVP. Automatically.**

Here's how it works:

1. **Capture** — Highlight a conversation in ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini
2. **Extract** — chat2repo pulls out the spec, journeys, and contracts
3. **Build** — A cloud agent scaffolds your project, stubs the UI, sets up the backend
4. **Ship** — You get a PR, a README, and optionally a live Vercel preview

**You get a notification: "Your MVP is ready."**

This is the jump from *saving ideas* to *building products*.
