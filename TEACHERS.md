# chat2repo for Teachers

**Stop losing your best ChatGPT lessons. Build a personal teaching library that grows while you work.**

## The Problem You Know Too Well

You've been here:

- You had a **brilliant ChatGPT conversation** about teaching *Macbeth* last month — where is it now?
- You **copy-paste bits into Word or Google Docs**, but it's messy and you never go back
- Every September you're **rebuilding the same lessons from scratch**
- You know you created a great set of exam questions somewhere... but *where*?

Your best teaching ideas are scattered across chat history, random documents, and your memory.

**chat2repo fixes this.**

## What You Actually Get

### A Private "Teacher Brain" That Remembers Everything

Every time ChatGPT gives you something worth keeping:

1. You click **one button** on the message
2. It's saved to your **private teacher notebook** online
3. You can **search it later** by topic, year group, text, or type

No more:
- "What was that Othello lesson plan I made?"
- "Where's that set of poetry questions from last term?"
- "I know I created something for this..."

It's all in one place. Forever. Searchable.

### Reusable Lesson Packs Instead of One-Off Chats

When you're happy with something ChatGPT created:

1. Add tags at the end: `#LessonPlan #Macbeth #Year10`
2. Click the save button
3. It goes into your organized teaching library

Next year when *Macbeth* comes around, your whole stack of lessons is already there — you tweak, not rebuild.

**After one term, you basically have a reusable scheme of work without extra effort.**

### Little Robots That Work For You

Once your notes are saved, automated helpers can:

| What happens | What you get |
|--------------|--------------|
| You save something tagged `#LessonPlan` | It's automatically formatted into your standard template |
| You save `#ExamQuestions` | Questions are filed into your growing question bank |
| Every morning at 7am | You get an email: "Here's what you created yesterday" |
| End of term | All your `#Year9` notes compiled into one document |

You don't manage this. You just see: **"I tagged it, and useful things happened."**

## How It Works (Simple Version)

### 1. Install Once
A small button appears inside ChatGPT. That's it.

### 2. Use ChatGPT Exactly As You Do Now
Keep planning lessons, writing emails, creating tests. Nothing changes.

### 3. When Something Is Worth Keeping
Either:
- Add tags at the end: `#LessonPlan #Poetry #Year8`
- Or ask ChatGPT: *"Summarize this for my notes and add sensible tags"*

Then click the **paper airplane button** on that message.

### 4. That's It
The note is saved. Your little robots tidy it up in the background.

**No new app. No new login. Just: plan as normal, click when something is good.**

## Example: A Real Planning Session

**You ask ChatGPT:**
> "Create a 50-minute lesson on Act 1 Scene 3 of Othello for Year 11, with learning objectives, a starter, main activity, and homework. Include differentiation for mixed ability. #LessonPlan #Othello #Year11 #Differentiation"

**ChatGPT gives you a great response.**

**You click the paper airplane button.**

**Result:**
- Saved to your teaching library
- Tagged and searchable
- Next September, you search `#Othello #Year11` and it's right there
